# terraform-null-label [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-null-label?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d097280a52a3d4ae8db7221) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module designed to generate consistent names and tags for resources. Use `terraform-null-label` to implement a strict naming convention.

A label follows the following convention: `{namespace}-{environment}-{stage}-{name}-{attributes}`. The delimiter (e.g. `-`) is interchangeable.
The label items are all optional. So if you prefer the term `stage` to `environment` you can exclude environment and the label `id` will look like `{namespace}-{stage}-{name}-{attributes}`.
If attributes are excluded but `stage` and `environment` are included, `id` will look like `{namespace}-{environment}-{stage}-{name}`

It's recommended to use one `terraform-null-label` module for every unique resource of a given resource type.
For example, if you have 10 instances, there should be 10 different labels.
However, if you have multiple different kinds of resources (e.g. instances, security groups, file systems, and elastic ips), then they can all share the same label assuming they are logically related.

All [Cloud Posse modules](https://github.com/cloudposse?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=terraform-&type=&language=) use this module to ensure resources can be instantiated multiple times within an account and without conflict.

**NOTE:** The `null` refers to the primary Terraform [provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) used in this module.

Releases of this module from `0.12.0` onward support `HCL2` and only work with Terraform 0.12 or newer.  Releases prior to this are compatible with earlier versions of terraform like Terraform 0.11.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/releases).


### Simple Example

```hcl
module "eg_prod_bastion_label" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["public"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "XYZ",
    "Snapshot"     = "true"
  }
}
```

This will create an `id` with the value of `eg-prod-bastion-public` because when generating `id`, the default order is `namespace`, `environment`, `stage`,  `name`, `attributes`
(you can override it by using the `label_order` variable, see [Advanced Example 3](#advanced-example-3)).

Now reference the label when creating an instance:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_public" {
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
  tags          = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.tags
}
```

Or define a security group:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_public" {
  vpc_id = var.vpc_id
  name   = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.id
  tags   = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.tags
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```


### Advanced Example

Here is a more complex example with two instances using two different labels. Note how efficiently the tags are defined for both the instance and the security group.

```hcl
module "eg_prod_bastion_abc_label" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["abc"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "XYZ",
    "Snapshot"     = "true"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_abc" {
  name = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.id
  tags = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.tags
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_abc" {
   instance_type          = "t1.micro"
   tags                   = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.tags
   vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.eg_prod_bastion_abc.id]
}

module "eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["xyz"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "XYZ",
    "Snapshot"     = "true"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_xyz" {
  name = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.id
  tags = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.tags
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_xyz" {
   instance_type          = "t1.micro"
   tags                   = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.tags
   vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.eg_prod_bastion_xyz.id]
}
```

### Advanced Example 2

Here is a more complex example with an autoscaling group that has a different tagging schema than other resources and requires its tags to be in this format, which this module can generate:

```hcl
tags = [
    {
        key = Name,
        propagate_at_launch = 1,
        value = namespace-stage-name
    },
    {
        key = Namespace,
        propagate_at_launch = 1,
        value = namespace
    },
    {
        key = Stage,
        propagate_at_launch = 1,
        value = stage
    }
]
```

Autoscaling group using propagating tagging below (full example: [autoscalinggroup](examples/autoscalinggroup/main.tf))

```hcl
################################
# terraform-null-label example #
################################
module "label" {
  source    = "../../"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"

  tags = {
    BusinessUnit = "Finance"
    ManagedBy    = "Terraform"
  }

  additional_tag_map = {
    propagate_at_launch = "true"
  }
}

    tags                                = module.label.tags
  }
}

  vpc_zone_identifier                   = data.aws_subnet_ids.all.ids
  max_size                              = "1"

  launch_template = {
    id                                  = "aws_launch_template.default.id
    version                             = "$$Latest"
  }

  # terraform-null-label example used here: Set tags on ASG and EC2 Servers
  tags                                  = module.label.tags_as_list_of_maps
}
```

### Advanced Example 3

See [complete example](./examples/complete)

This example shows how you can pass the `context` output of one label module to the next label_module,
allowing you to create one label that has the base set of values, and then creating every extra label
as a derivative of that.

```hcl
module "label1" {
  source      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  namespace   = "CloudPosse"
  environment = "UAT"
  stage       = "build"
  name        = "Winston Churchroom"
  attributes  = ["fire", "water", "earth", "air"]
  delimiter   = "-"

  label_order = ["name", "environment", "stage", "attributes"]

  tags = {
    "City"        = "Dublin"
    "Environment" = "Private"
  }
}

module "label2" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  context   = module.label1.context
  name      = "Charlie"
  stage     = "test"
  delimiter = "+"

  tags = {
    "City"        = "London"
    "Environment" = "Public"
  }
}

module "label3" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref=master"
  name      = "Starfish"
  stage     = "release"
  context   = module.label1.context
  delimiter = "."

  tags = {
    "Eat"    = "Carrot"
    "Animal" = "Rabbit"
  }
}
```

This creates label outputs like this:

```hcl
label1 = {
  "attributes" = [
    "fire",
    "water",
    "earth",
    "air",
  ]
  "delimiter" = "-"

  "delimiter" = "-"
  "enabled" = true
  "environment" = "uat"

    "Name" = "winstonchurchroom"
    "Namespace" = "cloudposse"
    "Stage" = "build"
  }
}
label1_tags = {
  "Attributes" = "fire-water-earth-air"
  "City" = "Dublin"
  "Environment" = "Private"
  "Name" = "winstonchurchroom"
  "Namespace" = "cloudposse"
  "Stage" = "build"
}
label2 = {

  "namespace" = "cloudposse"
  "stage" = "test"
}
label2_context = {
  "additional_tag_map" = {}
